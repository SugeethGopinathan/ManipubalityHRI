# rtt-fri-cartesian-impedance
## Information
This is a rtt wrapper around fri to control Kuka LWR 4+. It uses [rst-rt](https://github.com/corlab/rst-rt) for data-types and might be merged into [rtt-lwr-hardware-integration](https://github.com/corlab/rtt-lwr-hardware-integration) later.
It is not part of rtt-lwr-hardware-integration for two main reasons: firstly, it cannot have the same transparent switching between simulator and hardware due to the fact that simulator misses the cartesian impedance control. Secondly, this component is at alpha stage for the moment.
